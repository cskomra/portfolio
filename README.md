## Project Portfolio

I used responsive web design to build this web place to show off some of my project work.  It has three sections:
- Personal Information (name, title, logo)
- Banner Graphic (for personal branding)
- Featured Projects (project graphic, GitHub link, modal with description and link to live site)

### About the Featured Projects Section
In the Featured Projects section, click on a project's name to go to its GitHub repository. Click on a project's graphic to open a small window containing a description of the project and a link to run the code (when available).
